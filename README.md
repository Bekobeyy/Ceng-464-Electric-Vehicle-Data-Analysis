* __Abstract__. This project evaluates the performance of various classification models on a dataset. The models are trained 
on the original dataset, a dataset balanced with SMOTE, and a dataset balanced with Random Oversampling. The 
performance of each model is evaluated using several metrics.

# 1 Introduction
 In this report, we present the results of our data mining project. The goal of this project is to classify the data using 
various machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance. We have used ten different algorithms, including 
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boost, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, Ada Boost, Neural 
Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent, to classify the data. The models are trained on three versions of the dataset: 
the original dataset, a dataset balanced with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), and a dataset 
balanced with Random Oversampling with 5-fold cross-validation.

# 5 Conclusions
 The analysis reveals varying degrees of performance across different classifiers on the SMOTE-resampled data. 
The Random Forest classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy and F1 score, suggesting its effectiveness in handling 
the resampled dataset. However, the choice of the best classifier depends on the specific goals and requirements of the 
application. Further fine-tuning and optimization of hyperparameters could potentially enhance the performance of the 
classifiers. Overall, this study contributes insights into the impact of SMOTE resampling on classifier performance, 
aiding in the selection of suitable models for imbalanced datasets.
